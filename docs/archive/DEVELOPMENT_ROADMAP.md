## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
1. Use TypeScript for all files
2. Follow Next.js App Router patterns
3. Implement Server Components where possible
4. Use Server Actions for mutations
5. Maintain consistent file structure
6. Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
7. Keep components small and focused

### Git Workflow
1. Commit after each completed task
2. Use conventional commit messages
3. Create feature branches for major changes
